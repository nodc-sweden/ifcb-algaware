# Uploading Metadata to the IFCB Dashboard

This guide describes how to upload the yearly metadata file to the IFCB
dashboard so that cruise numbers are correctly assigned to samples. This
step is required before using the **Cruise** selection mode in the
standard AlgAware workflow (see [Standard AlgAware
Workflow](https://nodc-sweden.github.io/ifcb-algaware/articles/workflow.md)).

**Network requirement:** The IFCB dashboard is hosted on an internal
SMHI server. You must be connected to the SMHI office network or SMHI
VPN to access it. This requirement also applies to the standard AlgAware
workflow.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Background

Cruise numbers are assigned to IFCB samples via a metadata CSV file that
is generated automatically once per hour on the SMHI file server — but
only when new samples are available. The file reads a
`cruise_numbers.txt` configuration file to match cruise numbers with
time intervals.

After new cruise information has been added to `cruise_numbers.txt`, the
updated metadata file must be uploaded to the dashboard manually.
Without this step, samples from a new cruise will appear with the
placeholder cruise number `SVEA_YYYY_NA` instead of the correct cruise
identifier.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Prerequisites

- Access to the SMHI network (office or VPN)
- An account on the IFCB dashboard with Settings access
- The yearly metadata file for the current year, located on the utv file
  server at:

&nbsp;

    /data/utv/ifcb/work/data/ifcbdb_metadata/ifcb_dashboard_metadata_Svea_YYYY.csv

Replace `YYYY` with the current four-digit year.

**Do not open or edit the metadata file in Excel.** Excel may silently
change the file encoding, which will corrupt the upload. If you need to
inspect or edit the file (e.g. to add a missing cruise number to
`cruise_numbers.txt`), use a plain-text editor and separate fields with
a tab character.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step-by-step: uploading metadata

### 1. Log in to the IFCB dashboard

Navigate to <http://ifcb-dashboard-utv.smhi.se/> in your browser.

If you are not already logged in, click the **Log in** link at the
bottom of the page.

### 2. Open Settings and click Upload Metadata

After logging in, click the **⚙ Settings** menu (cogwheel icon, top
right). On the Settings page, click **Upload Metadata**.

### 3. Select the file and upload

On the Upload Metadata page:

1.  Click **Browse** and locate the metadata file for the current year
    on the utv file server:
    `/data/utv/ifcb/work/data/ifcbdb_metadata/ifcb_dashboard_metadata_Svea_YYYY.csv`
2.  Click **UPLOAD**.

A confirmation message will appear once the upload is complete:

> *Complete. X bins modified, Y error(s)*

upload](../reference/figures/ifcbdb-upload-complete.png)

The number of modified bins depends on how many new samples have been
collected since the last upload.

**“Bin not found” errors are expected and can be ignored.** These occur
when the metadata file references sample bins that have not yet been
ingested into the dashboard (e.g. from deleted samples).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 4 (optional): verify that the cruise appears

To confirm the upload worked:

1.  Go to the dashboard home page and click on the **RV Svea** dataset.
2.  Click **Filter**.
3.  Open the **Cruise** dropdown — the latest cruise number should now
    be listed.

If the cruise is still missing, proceed to the troubleshooting section
below.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Action |
|----|----|----|
| Cruise shows as `SVEA_YYYY_NA` | Cruise number not in `cruise_numbers.txt` | Add the cruise number to the end of `cruise_numbers.txt` using a text editor (tab-separated fields). Wait up to one hour for the metadata file to regenerate, then re-upload. |
| Cruise not listed after upload | Metadata file not yet regenerated | Wait up to one hour and re-upload, or contact the maintainer. |
| Upload fails / dashboard unreachable | Network or server issue | Check SMHI VPN connection; contact the maintainer if the server appears down. |
| No cruise number available | Metadata workflow cannot be resolved in time | Use **Date Range** selection in the AlgAware app instead of **Cruise**. |

For persistent issues, contact **Anders Torstensson** (maintainer).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Notes for maintainers

- The metadata file is regenerated **once per hour** by a scheduled
  script, provided new samples are available.
- The script reads
  `/data/utv/ifcb/work/data/ifcbdb_metadata/cruise_numbers.txt` to map
  cruise numbers to time intervals.
- Adding a new cruise season requires a **manual edit** of
  `cruise_numbers.txt` — append a new line at the end of the file with
  tab-separated fields. This step is easy to forget and will result in
  `SVEA_YYYY_NA` assignments until it is done.
- If the scheduled script itself fails, it requires maintainer
  intervention to restart.
