# Standard AlgAware Workflow

This guide walks through the complete workflow for processing a cruise
with AlgAware-IFCB, from loading data to generating a finished Word
report. Follow the steps in order.

Before starting, make sure you have completed the [installation and
configuration](https://nodc-sweden.github.io/ifcb-algaware/articles/installation.md)
steps.

> **Network requirement:** This workflow requires access to the SMHI
> internal network. Connect via the SMHI office network or SMHI VPN
> before proceeding.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## App layout

The application has two main areas:

- **Sidebar** (left) — a collapsible accordion with four panels:
  *Settings*, *Data*, *Validate*, and *Report*. This is where you
  trigger actions.
- **Main panel** (right) — tabs for browsing and reviewing data:
  *Validate* (image gallery), *Samples*, *Images*, *Maps*, *Plots*,
  *CTD*, and *Summary*.

![App overview showing sidebar and main
tabs](../reference/figures/screenshot-launch.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Launch the application

``` r
library(algaware)
launch_app()
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Load cruise data

Open the **Data** panel in the sidebar (it is open by default).

![Data panel in the
sidebar](../reference/figures/screenshot-data-sidebar.png)

Data panel in the sidebar

1.  Choose **Cruise** or **Date Range** using the radio buttons.
    - *Cruise*: select the cruise number from the dropdown after
      fetching metadata. For cruise numbers to appear, the yearly
      metadata file must have been uploaded to the IFCB dashboard — see
      [Uploading Metadata to the IFCB
      Dashboard](https://nodc-sweden.github.io/ifcb-algaware/articles/ifcb-dashboard-metadata.md).
    - *Date Range*: pick start and end dates.
2.  Click Fetch Metadata. The app downloads the sample list from the
    IFCB Dashboard and populates the cruise dropdown. The status text
    below the buttons shows how many bins and cruises were found.
3.  Select the correct cruise from the dropdown (if using cruise mode).
4.  Click Load Data. This single button runs the full loading pipeline:
    - Matches bins to AlgAware monitoring stations
    - Downloads raw (`.roi`/`.hdr`) files and feature files from the
      Dashboard
    - Copies HDF5 classification files from your Classification Path
    - Reads and processes the classifier predictions
    - Computes biovolumes and station summaries
    - Collects FerryBox chlorophyll data (if configured)

    A progress bar tracks each step. The status text at the bottom of
    the Data panel shows the final result (number of bins, stations, and
    classes found).

> **Files are cached locally.** Subsequent loads of the same cruise are
> much faster because the downloaded files already exist in your Local
> Storage Path.

Once loading is complete, the **Validate** panel in the sidebar opens
automatically.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Browse and validate images

### The validation philosophy

The goal is to **browse through every class** for both regions (Baltic
Sea and West Coast) before generating the report. A class that you leave
untouched is considered validated — you have seen the images and
accepted the classifier’s predictions as correct. You do not need to
take any action unless you find something that needs correcting.

How much effort you put into re-labelling is entirely up to you. At
minimum, step through each class with the arrow buttons and scan the
images. If everything looks right, move on. Only act when you see clear
misclassifications or something unusual.

> **Tip:** Spend a bit more time exploring the unclassified images, as
> they often reveal gaps in the model. They may include taxa not yet
> represented, as well as groups that are currently poorly classified.
> In some cases, you may need to add custom classes for new taxa or
> provide additional annotations to improve performance.

### Gallery (main *Validate* tab)

The main panel switches to the **Validate** tab showing the image
gallery.

![Image gallery in the Validate
tab](../reference/figures/screenshot-gallery.png)

Image gallery in the Validate tab

- **Region toggle** — switch between Baltic Sea and West Coast. Each
  region has its own class list. Work through both before generating the
  report.
- **Class dropdown** — select a taxon to browse. Use the ◀ and ▶ arrows
  to step through classes one at a time. Each entry shows two names: the
  raw class name as output by the classifier model, and a clean
  taxonomic name in blue — this is the name images will be aggregated to
  in the report. Classes ending in `-like` (or equivalent *cf.* classes)
  are mapped to the taxonomic level above and merged with that parent
  taxon.
- **Page size** — choose 50, 100, or 200 images per page.
- Select Page — tick all images on the current page for a validation
  action.
- Deselect — clear the selection.
- **Measure tool** (ruler icon) — click and drag on an image to estimate
  size on screen.

Click any image to select or deselect it individually.

### Validate panel (sidebar)

The **Validate** panel in the sidebar contains the action buttons. They
act on whatever is currently shown or selected in the gallery.

![Validate panel in the
sidebar](../reference/figures/screenshot-validation-sidebar.png)

Validate panel in the sidebar

| Button             | What it does                                                                                                                                                               |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Store Annotations  | Save selected images to the SQLite database (permanent, for classifier training)                                                                                           |
| Relabel Selected   | Move selected images to a different class (session-only)                                                                                                                   |
| Relabel Class      | Move all images of the current class in the current region to a different class (session-only)                                                                             |
| Invalidate Class   | Move all images of the current class to unclassified, so they no longer contribute to that taxon’s biovolume or appear in plots and reports under that name (session-only) |
| Add Custom Class   | Add a taxon not in the database or taxa lookup (session-only)                                                                                                              |
| Import corrections | Upload a corrections CSV from a previous session to replay earlier work                                                                                                    |

The status summary below the buttons shows how many images are selected
and a running log of corrections made this session.

### When to use each action

**Re-labelling** is the most common correction. Use Relabel Selected to
move a handful of individual images, or Relabel Class when the entire
class is systematically wrong (e.g. all images are actually a different
species).

**Invalidating** a class with Invalidate Class is appropriate when the
class contains so many errors that it should not appear under that taxon
name in biovolume summaries, plots, or the report. The images are moved
to the unclassified pool — they remain visible in the gallery and still
contribute to the unclassified fraction, but no longer count as that
taxon.

**Storing annotations** with Store Annotations is intended for
situations where you encounter something unusual — a rare species, a
life stage the classifier has rarely seen, or images where you are
confident in the identification and the training data coverage is poor.
Saving these images helps improve future classifier versions. For
routine corrections use the relabel buttons instead — those are faster
and do not require a configured database folder.

> **Session-only vs. permanent:** Relabelling and invalidation only
> affect the current session. To carry corrections forward to the next
> session, export the corrections log from the Report panel and
> re-import it using Import corrections.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Review and exclude samples (optional)

Click the **Samples** tab in the main panel to see all loaded samples.

![Samples tab with the exclusion
table](../reference/figures/screenshot-samples.png)

Samples tab with the exclusion table

The table lists every sample bin with its station, region, timestamp,
and ROI file size. Samples marked *Excluded* are removed from all
summaries, maps, mosaics, and the report — but remain in memory and can
be re-included at any time.

Typical reasons to exclude a sample:

- **Instrument problem** — the IFCB was clogging, running air, or
  otherwise malfunctioning during that sample. You may notice this in
  the gallery as a bin dominated by bubbles, debris, or empty frames.

- **Mainly bubbles** — a sample where the vast majority of images are
  air bubbles rather than particles, often caused by a brief air intake.
  Check the ROI file size in the table: an unusually small file can
  indicate very few real particles were captured.

- **FerryBox system fault** — if you know the ship’s flow-through system
  was shut down, flushing with cleaning fluid, or otherwise not sampling
  surface water at the time of the IFCB trigger, the sample does not
  represent the water mass and should be excluded.

- **Station mismatch** — a sample that was spatially matched to a
  station but was actually collected well outside the expected position
  (e.g. during transit between stations).

- Select rows in the table, then click Exclude Selected to exclude them.

- Select excluded rows and click Include Selected to reinstate them.

- Click Include All to reset all exclusions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Load CTD and chlorophyll data (optional)

Click the **CTD** tab in the main panel.

![CTD tab with loaded region
figure](../reference/figures/screenshot-ctd.png)

CTD tab with loaded region figure

This step improves the chlorophyll map and adds fluorescence profile
panels and Chl-a time-series panels to the report.

1.  **CNV Folder Path** — paste the path to the cruise’s `Cnv/` folder
    (the app searches recursively for `.cnv` files). This folder is
    typically found inside the expedition’s `EXRAPP` folder, e.g.
    `EXRAPP/2026/CTD/2026/Cnv`.
2.  **LIMS data.txt** — click Browse and select the LIMS export file
    (optional but recommended for verified Chl-a values). For the best
    time series plots, export all chlorophyll data for the current year
    from LIMS — not just the current cruise — so that earlier station
    visits from the same year appear as points in the historical
    comparison panels.
3.  Click Load CTD Data.

After loading, regional panels appear in the tab. The tab title gains a
green **loaded** badge to confirm CTD data is ready for the report.

> **What is shown in the chlorophyll map?** See [Chlorophyll map
> options](#chlorophyll-map-options) below.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Design image mosaics

Click the **Images** tab in the main panel.

![Images tab — mosaic
designer](../reference/figures/screenshot-images.png)

Images tab — mosaic designer

The image mosaics (one for Baltic Sea, one for West Coast) are grids of
representative phytoplankton images included in the Word report. The
taxa are pre-selected and ordered by biovolume, with the most dominant
taxon first — giving a visual summary of what characterised the
phytoplankton community during the cruise.

1.  Choose a **region** (Baltic Sea or West Coast).
2.  Set the **number of images** per taxon.
3.  Select **taxa** using the taxon picker (top taxa by biovolume are
    pre-selected).
4.  Click Generate Mosaic. The app picks random images for each taxon
    and assembles the grid.
5.  Click any individual image to re-roll a new random image for that
    taxon only.

Repeat for the other region. Both mosaics must be generated before the
Report panel shows them as ready.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Review maps and plots

The **Maps** and **Plots** tabs in the main panel update automatically
as data loads and corrections are applied.

- **Maps tab**: image count map, phytoplankton group composition pie
  map, and chlorophyll map.
- **Plots tab**: heatmap and stacked bar chart for Baltic Sea and West
  Coast.
- **Summary tab**: interactive, sortable table of biovolume per station
  and taxon.

No action is required — these tabs are for visual review before
generating the report.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Generate the report

Open the **Report** panel in the sidebar.

![Report panel in the
sidebar](../reference/figures/screenshot-report-sidebar.png)

Report panel in the sidebar

### Chlorophyll source

The **Chlorophyll source** dropdown at the top of the Report panel
selects which data source is used for the chlorophyll map in the report.
The dropdown shows only the sources that have been loaded:

| Option               | Requires                                             |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| FerryBox             | FerryBox data path configured in Settings            |
| CTD (0–20 m)         | CNV files loaded in the CTD tab                      |
| LIMS bottle (0–20 m) | LIMS data.txt loaded in the CTD tab                  |
| LIMS hose (0–10 m)   | LIMS data.txt with SLA samples loaded in the CTD tab |

The best available source is pre-selected automatically (hose \> bottle
\> CTD \> FerryBox). See [Chlorophyll map
options](#chlorophyll-map-options) for a full explanation of how each
source is calculated.

### Report readiness checklist

The checklist at the top of the Report panel shows which optional
components are ready:

- **IFCB data loaded** — turns green after a successful Load Data.
- **CTD data** — turns green after loading data in the CTD tab.
- **Baltic mosaic** — turns green after generating a mosaic in the
  Images tab.
- **West Coast mosaic** — turns green after generating a mosaic in the
  Images tab.

CTD data and mosaics are optional. The report is generated with whatever
is available.

### Fill in report metadata

- **Report No** — the report number within the series (e.g. `1`).
- **Dnr** — the SMHI diary number (e.g. `2026/718/2.1.3`).

### Generate

Click Make Report. The button label changes to *Generating…* while the
report is being assembled. Generation typically takes 1–5 minutes
depending on the number of stations and whether LLM text generation is
active.

When done, click Download Report to save the `.docx` file.

### Download the corrections log

Click Download Corrections to export all relabelling and invalidation
actions from this session as a CSV file. Save this alongside the report
for archiving. You can replay it next session using Import corrections
in the Validate panel.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Chlorophyll map options

The chlorophyll map shows surface chlorophyll concentrations at each
AlgAware station. Four data sources are supported. The selected source
(chosen in the **Chlorophyll source** dropdown in the Report panel) is
used both in the interactive map on the **Maps** tab and in the report.

### FerryBox

- **Source:** Continuous chlorophyll sensor data from the FerryBox
  system, read from CSV files in your FerryBox Data Path.
- **How it is calculated:** The FerryBox timestamp closest to each IFCB
  sample time is matched, and the mean chlorophyll value is computed per
  station.
- **Unit:** Relative fluorescence (sensor-dependent, not analytically
  verified).
- **Availability:** Data are normally available immediately after the
  cruise.
- **Best for:** A quick spatial overview directly after the cruise when
  no laboratory data are yet available.

### CTD (0–20 m)

- **Source:** SeaBird CTD fluorescence profiles from `.cnv` files loaded
  in the CTD tab.
- **How it is calculated:** All depth samples from 0–20 m are extracted
  from each CTD cast and averaged per station
  ([`compute_ctd_chl_avg()`](https://nodc-sweden.github.io/ifcb-algaware/reference/compute_ctd_chl_avg.md)).
  If a station has multiple casts (e.g. two instruments or an upcast
  alongside a downcast), upcasts are discarded and the deepest downcast
  per date is kept.
- **Unit:** CTD fluorescence in nominally µg/L — a relative chlorophyll
  signal, not analytically verified Chl-a.
- **Availability:** Data are normally available immediately after the
  cruise.
- **Best for:** Spatial overview when FerryBox data are unavailable but
  CTD profiles exist, and as a depth-resolved complement to bottle data.

### LIMS bottle (0–20 m)

- **Source:** Discrete Niskin bottle samples analyzed in the laboratory.
  Values are exported from LIMS as `data.txt` and loaded in the CTD tab.
- **How it is calculated:** All bottle samples at depths ≤ 20 m are
  averaged per station
  ([`compute_lims_chl_avg()`](https://nodc-sweden.github.io/ifcb-algaware/reference/compute_lims_chl_avg.md)).
  Integrated hose samples (those with `"-SLA_"` in the sample number)
  are excluded from this calculation. If a station appears with slightly
  varying coordinates across rows, all rows are collapsed to a single
  map point.
- **Unit:** Analytically measured Chl-a in µg/L (filtered and extracted,
  quality-controlled by the laboratory).
- **Availability:** Laboratory results are typically available a few
  days after the cruise in delayed mode.
- **Best for:** The highest-quality chlorophyll map once laboratory
  results are available.

### LIMS hose (0–10 m)

- **Source:** Hose (integrated) samples analyzed in the laboratory. The
  same LIMS `data.txt` export is used; rows where the sample number
  (`SMPNO`) contains `"-SLA_"` are identified as hose samples.
- **How it is identified:** Hose samples represent a water-column
  integration over 0–10 m collected with a hose sampler rather than a
  discrete Niskin bottle.
- **How it is calculated:** All hose samples at a station are averaged
  ([`compute_lims_hose_avg()`](https://nodc-sweden.github.io/ifcb-algaware/reference/compute_lims_hose_avg.md)).
  No depth filtering is applied because the hose already integrates the
  surface layer.
- **Unit:** Analytically measured Chl-a in µg/L.
- **Availability:** As for LIMS bottle — available in delayed mode a few
  days after the cruise.
- **Best for:** Direct comparison with the regular phytoplankton
  microscopy monitoring, since microscope samples are also taken from
  the hose. This makes LIMS hose the most consistent chlorophyll
  reference for stations where standard monitoring is carried out.
