# Changelog

## algaware 0.1.0

First release.

### Shiny application

- Interactive Shiny app
  ([`launch_app()`](https://nodc-sweden.github.io/ifcb-algaware/reference/launch_app.md))
  for end-to-end IFCB cruise reporting.
- Sidebar workflow: Settings → Data → Validate → Report.
- Loading overlay with smooth fade-in on first render.

### Data loading

- Downloads IFCB samples from an IFCB Dashboard instance for a selected
  cruise or date range.
- Automatic spatial matching of IFCB samples to AlgAware monitoring
  stations using a configurable bin radius.
- Merges FerryBox chlorophyll fluorescence from a locally configured
  data folder.
- Processes HDF5 classification files together with feature files into
  biovolumes and carbon estimates using iRfcb.
- SQLite annotation database (ClassiPyR-compatible schema) for exporting
  validated image annotations as training data.

### Validation

- Gallery tab for browsing IFCB images organised by class.
- Per-image and per-class relabelling (reassign to any class in the
  global class list or a custom class) and invalidation.
- Custom class creation with full scientific name, AphiaID, HAB flag,
  and italic formatting metadata.
- Corrections log importable in future sessions to replay relabellings
  automatically.

### Samples tab

- Table view of all samples with exclusion/re-inclusion controls.
- Excluded samples are removed from all summaries, maps, mosaics, and
  the report.

### Images (mosaic designer)

- Interactive mosaic builder for Baltic Sea and West Coast images.
- Binary-search layout algorithm to maximise image size within canvas
  bounds (rectpacker).
- Per-taxon image re-rolling and configurable image count per mosaic.

### Maps and plots

- Station maps: image count, phytoplankton group composition pie chart
  (Diatoms, Dinoflagellates, Cyanobacteria, Cryptophytes, Mesodinium
  spp., Silicoflagellates, Other), and chlorophyll maps.
- Cyanobacteria pie slice colour: teal-cyan (`#14B8A6`).
- Image count map legend: “Images (counts/L)”; width matched to
  chlorophyll map so y-axes align in the Word report.
- Chlorophyll source selector: FerryBox, CTD fluorescence, LIMS bottle
  (0–20 m), or LIMS hose-integrated (0–10 m).
- Regional heatmaps and stacked bar charts for Baltic Sea and West
  Coast.
- Summary DT table with per-station taxa and biovolume data.

### CTD panel

- Fluorescence depth profiles per station from CNV files (`oce`).
- Regional Chl-a time-series with 1991–2020 climatological mean ± SD
  ribbon.
- Automatic station name synonym resolution via `station_mapper.txt`.

### Word report generation

- Generates a Word `.docx` report from an `officer` template with:
  - Front page with logo, diarienummer, phytoplankton group composition
    pie map, and report number.
  - Swedish summary (Sammanfattning) and English summary (Abstract).
  - Cruise metadata table.
  - Image mosaic overview with numbered captions and italic species
    formatting.
  - Image count map, chlorophyll map, heatmaps, and stacked bar charts.
  - Per-station sections with image mosaics.
  - CTD fluorescence profiles and Chl-a time-series.
- Species names are italicised in Word output; HAB taxa are marked with
  a red bold asterisk.

### LLM text generation

- Optional AI-generated report text via OpenAI (`OPENAI_API_KEY`) or
  Google Gemini (`GEMINI_API_KEY`).
- Generates Swedish summary, English summary, and individual station
  descriptions guided by a configurable writing guide
  (`inst/extdata/report_writing_guide.md`).
- HAB taxa are deterministically marked with `*` regardless of LLM
  output.
- Default OpenAI model: `gpt-5.1`. Override via `OPENAI_MODEL`
  environment variable.
- Retry on HTTP 429 (rate-limited) and 503 (service overload) with
  exponential back-off up to 120 s.
- Bloom alert instructions appended to prompts when conditions are met:
  spring bloom (West Coast, Jan–Feb, diatoms \> 50 % biovolume at any
  station, chl \> 3 µg/L) and cyanobacterial bloom (Baltic, Jun–Aug,
  cyanobacteria \> 50 % biovolume at any station, chl \> 3 µg/L).

### Taxa lookup and warning levels

- Bundled `taxa_lookup.csv` maps classifier class names to WoRMS
  scientific names, AphiaID, HAB flag, italic formatting, warning level
  abundance, and sflag qualifiers.
- Custom classes can be added interactively in the app and are merged
  into the taxa lookup at report time.

### Configuration

- `inst/extdata/standard_stations.yaml` — standard CTD stations and
  regional groupings.
- `inst/extdata/station_mapper.txt` — raw station name synonyms for
  CNV/LIMS matching.
- `inst/extdata/annual_1991-2020_statistics_chl20m.txt` — Chl-a
  climatology for CTD time-series ribbon.
- `inst/extdata/report_writing_guide.md` — LLM system prompt / style
  guide.
- `inst/config/phyto_groups.yaml` — phytoplankton group definitions
  (class, phylum, genus mappings for WoRMS lookup). Edit to add or
  rename groups without touching R code. Read via the exported
  [`assign_phyto_groups()`](https://nodc-sweden.github.io/ifcb-algaware/reference/assign_phyto_groups.md).
