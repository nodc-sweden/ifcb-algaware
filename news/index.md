# Changelog

## algaware (development version)

### Minor improvements and fixes

- Abbreviate repeated species binomials across the whole Station reports
  section: a species written out in full at one station (e.g. *Nodularia
  spumigena*) is abbreviated (*N. spumigena*) at any later station,
  following standard biological convention.
- Also abbreviate repeated binomials within each summary (English and
  Swedish treated separately): a species spelled out in full in the West
  Coast part or the HAB sentence is abbreviated where it recurs in the
  Baltic part of the same summary.
- Order report sections consistently with West Coast before Baltic Sea
  throughout (heatmaps, relative-biovolume bars, station reports, image
  mosaics and the front-page mosaic overview), matching the order
  already used in the summary/abstract.
- Fix the generated Word report sometimes disappearing (failed download)
  when page numbering was post-processed. The report is no longer
  deleted before being rebuilt, and the rebuild uses the `zip` package
  instead of an external `zip` executable that may be missing on some
  servers.
- Stop Microsoft Word prompting to update fields (“This document
  contains fields that may refer to other files…”) when opening the
  report, by clearing the dirty-field flags on the page-number field.
  Page numbers still update automatically.
- Fix station-visit aggregation silently dropping taxa whose biovolume
  or carbon value was missing (e.g. a failed or missing feature file).
  Such rows were discarded entirely, including their valid cell counts,
  which under-reported counts and skewed the per-litre concentrations
  and presence categories. Aggregation now tolerates `NA` measures per
  column.
- Fix a double-counting risk when re-joining `AphiaID` after
  aggregation: a taxon name mapping to more than one `AphiaID` could
  duplicate its rows and inflate biovolume in the report. The join now
  keeps a single `AphiaID` per taxon, preferring a non-missing value.
- Require `ggplot2` (\>= 3.4.0) for the `linewidth` aesthetic used in
  CTD figures, and `tidyr` (\>= 1.1.0) for
  `pivot_wider()`/`pivot_longer()`.
- Split llm.R, plots.R and report.R into manageable file sizes
- Migrate pie chart plotting from internal functions to `SHARK4R` 1.2.0
- Fix biomass and chlorophyll maps failing with “no rows to aggregate”
  when FerryBox provides no valid chlorophyll readings. The chlorophyll
  column is now omitted when entirely missing, and map aggregation
  tolerates all-`NA` chlorophyll.
- Allow downloading the corrections log at any time after making
  corrections, without first generating the Word report.
- Fix the validation gallery getting stuck in an infinite loop,
  switching back and forth between two classes, when the class
  navigation arrows were clicked while a whole-class relabel was still
  in progress. Selectize echo events can no longer feed back into the
  current class index.
- Add an “Unclassify Selected” button to the Validate tab: a one-click
  shortcut that moves the selected images to “unclassified” without
  picking a target in the Relabel Selected dropdown.
- Rename the “Invalidate Selected” and “Invalidate Class” buttons to
  “Unclassify Selected” and “Unclassify Class”, and use the same wording
  in the validation status summary and import preview, so the label
  matches the resulting “unclassified” state.
- Fix stations with Swedish characters (e.g. `Å17`, `SLÄGGÖ`,
  `BY39 ÖLANDS SÖDRA UDDE`) silently dropping out on non-UTF-8 locales
  (such as Windows Server), which also removed whole sampling days from
  downloads, pie charts and the image-count cruise track. Every
  bundled/external text file is now read with its declared encoding
  (UTF-8 or latin1) and normalised to UTF-8, and station-name matching
  compares on UTF-8, so results no longer depend on the host machine’s
  locale.

## algaware 0.1.0

First release.

### Shiny application

- Interactive Shiny app
  ([`launch_app()`](https://nodc-sweden.github.io/ifcb-algaware/reference/launch_app.md))
  for end-to-end IFCB cruise reporting.
- Sidebar workflow: Settings → Data → Validate → Report.
- Loading overlay with smooth fade-in on first render.

### Data loading

- Downloads IFCB samples from an IFCB Dashboard instance for a selected
  cruise or date range.
- Automatic spatial matching of IFCB samples to AlgAware monitoring
  stations using a configurable bin radius.
- Merges FerryBox chlorophyll fluorescence from a locally configured
  data folder.
- Processes HDF5 classification files together with feature files into
  biovolumes and carbon estimates using iRfcb.
- SQLite annotation database (ClassiPyR-compatible schema) for exporting
  validated image annotations as training data.

### Validation

- Gallery tab for browsing IFCB images organised by class.
- Per-image and per-class relabelling (reassign to any class in the
  global class list or a custom class) and invalidation.
- Custom class creation with full scientific name, AphiaID, HAB flag,
  and italic formatting metadata.
- Corrections log importable in future sessions to replay relabellings
  automatically.

### Samples tab

- Table view of all samples with exclusion/re-inclusion controls.
- Excluded samples are removed from all summaries, maps, mosaics, and
  the report.

### Images (mosaic designer)

- Interactive mosaic builder for Baltic Sea and West Coast images.
- Binary-search layout algorithm to maximise image size within canvas
  bounds (rectpacker).
- Per-taxon image re-rolling and configurable image count per mosaic.

### Maps and plots

- Station maps: image count, phytoplankton group composition pie chart
  (Diatoms, Dinoflagellates, Cyanobacteria, Cryptophytes, Mesodinium
  spp., Silicoflagellates, Other), and chlorophyll maps.
- Cyanobacteria pie slice colour: teal-cyan (`#14B8A6`).
- Image count map legend: “Images (counts/L)”; width matched to
  chlorophyll map so y-axes align in the Word report.
- Chlorophyll source selector: FerryBox, CTD fluorescence, LIMS bottle
  (0–20 m), or LIMS hose-integrated (0–10 m).
- Regional heatmaps and stacked bar charts for Baltic Sea and West
  Coast.
- Summary DT table with per-station taxa and biovolume data.

### CTD panel

- Fluorescence depth profiles per station from CNV files (`oce`).
- Regional Chl-a time-series with 1991–2020 climatological mean ± SD
  ribbon.
- Automatic station name synonym resolution via `station_mapper.txt`.

### Word report generation

- Generates a Word `.docx` report from an `officer` template with:
  - Front page with logo, diarienummer, phytoplankton group composition
    pie map, and report number.
  - Swedish summary (Sammanfattning) and English summary (Abstract).
  - Cruise metadata table.
  - Image mosaic overview with numbered captions and italic species
    formatting.
  - Image count map, chlorophyll map, heatmaps, and stacked bar charts.
  - Per-station sections with image mosaics.
  - CTD fluorescence profiles and Chl-a time-series.
- Species names are italicised in Word output; HAB taxa are marked with
  a red bold asterisk.

### LLM text generation

- Optional AI-generated report text via OpenAI (`OPENAI_API_KEY`) or
  Google Gemini (`GEMINI_API_KEY`).
- Generates Swedish summary, English summary, and individual station
  descriptions guided by a configurable writing guide
  (`inst/extdata/report_writing_guide.md`).
- HAB taxa are deterministically marked with `*` regardless of LLM
  output.
- Default OpenAI model: `gpt-5.1`. Override via `OPENAI_MODEL`
  environment variable.
- Retry on HTTP 429 (rate-limited) and 503 (service overload) with
  exponential back-off up to 120 s.
- Bloom alert instructions appended to prompts when conditions are met:
  spring bloom (West Coast, Jan–Feb, diatoms \> 50 % biovolume at any
  station, chl \> 3 µg/L) and cyanobacterial bloom (Baltic, Jun–Aug,
  cyanobacteria \> 50 % biovolume at any station, chl \> 3 µg/L).

### Taxa lookup and warning levels

- Bundled `taxa_lookup.csv` maps classifier class names to WoRMS
  scientific names, AphiaID, HAB flag, italic formatting, warning level
  abundance, and sflag qualifiers.
- Custom classes can be added interactively in the app and are merged
  into the taxa lookup at report time.

### Configuration

- `inst/extdata/standard_stations.yaml` — standard CTD stations and
  regional groupings.
- `inst/extdata/station_mapper.txt` — raw station name synonyms for
  CNV/LIMS matching.
- `inst/extdata/annual_1991-2020_statistics_chl20m.txt` — Chl-a
  climatology for CTD time-series ribbon.
- `inst/extdata/report_writing_guide.md` — LLM system prompt / style
  guide.
- `inst/config/phyto_groups.yaml` — phytoplankton group definitions
  (class, phylum, genus mappings for WoRMS lookup). Edit to add or
  rename groups without touching R code. Read via the exported
  [`assign_phyto_groups()`](https://nodc-sweden.github.io/ifcb-algaware/reference/assign_phyto_groups.md).
