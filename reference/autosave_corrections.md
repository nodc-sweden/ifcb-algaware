# Auto-save the corrections log to the local storage path

Writes the same corrections CSV that the "Download corrections" button
produces – corrections plus any class threshold adjustments (see
[`build_corrections_export()`](https://nodc-sweden.github.io/ifcb-algaware/reference/build_corrections_export.md))
– to `<storage_path>/corrections/algaware_corrections_<YYYYMMDD>.csv`,
so that work lost to a crash – or to closing the app without downloading
– can be recovered with the existing "Import corrections" button. The
corrections log is cumulative, so each save overwrites the day's file
with the complete state.

## Usage

``` r
autosave_corrections(
  corrections,
  custom_classes,
  storage_path,
  backup_existing = FALSE,
  thresholds = NULL,
  allow_empty = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- corrections:

  Data frame of corrections (from `rv$corrections`).

- custom_classes:

  Data frame of custom classes (from `rv$custom_classes`).

- storage_path:

  The local storage path (from settings).

- backup_existing:

  Set `TRUE` on a session's first save: an already-existing target file
  must then come from an earlier session (e.g. one that crashed), so it
  is set aside as `..._prev.csv` instead of being overwritten. Later
  saves in the same session overwrite in place.

- thresholds:

  Optional data.frame of threshold adjustments from
  [`threshold_summary()`](https://nodc-sweden.github.io/ifcb-algaware/reference/threshold_summary.md).

- allow_empty:

  Write the file even when there are no corrections and no threshold
  adjustments. Used after an earlier save in the session, so undoing
  everything (e.g. resetting all thresholds) is not left out of the
  recovery file.

## Value

A list with `success` (logical), `path` (the file written, or the
intended target on failure) and `error` (message, or NULL). Returns
`success = FALSE` without writing when there is nothing to save or no
storage path is configured.

## Details

The CSV is first written to a temporary file in the same folder and then
renamed into place, so a crash mid-write can never leave a truncated
file where a previous good autosave was.
