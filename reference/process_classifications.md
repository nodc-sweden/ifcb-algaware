# Process classifications and compute station summaries

Reads H5 classification files, computes biovolume data for each
classified image, aggregates results by station visit, and extracts the
classifier name from the first H5 file and the trained per-class
thresholds (`NULL` when the files lack them or disagree). Non-biological
classes are excluded from biovolume but kept in the classification data
frame for gallery display.

## Usage

``` r
process_classifications(
  config,
  dirs,
  sample_ids,
  matched,
  cached_diatom_status = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- config:

  Reactive values with settings (`non_biological_classes`,
  `pixels_per_micron`).

- dirs:

  List with `raw_dir`, `feat_dir`, `class_dir` paths.

- sample_ids:

  Character vector of sample PIDs to process.

- matched:

  Data frame of station-matched metadata.

- cached_diatom_status:

  Optional data.frame from a previous
  [`resolve_diatom_status()`](https://nodc-sweden.github.io/ifcb-algaware/reference/resolve_diatom_status.md)
  call (e.g. an earlier load in the same session), so already-resolved
  classes skip the WoRMS lookup.

## Value

A named list, or NULL if no H5 classifications were found.
